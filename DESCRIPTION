Description: Sharp increases in Alzheimer disease (AD) cases, deaths, and
    costs are stressing the health care system and caregivers. Several major AD data
    sources exist which allows researchers to conduct their research. For example,
    the BIOCARD study is a longitudinal, observational study initiated in 1995, and
    designed to identify biomarkers associated with progression from cognitively
    normal to mild cognitive impairment or dementia; the ADNI study is a multicenter
    observation study launched in 2004, to collect clinical, imaging, genetic and
    biospecimen biomarkers from cohorts of different clinical states at baseline;
    the NACC UDS data is a collection of data reflecting the total enrollment since
    2005 across 34 AD Centers and includes subjects with a range of cognitive
    status. In this package, we establish AD data standards and data dictionaries in
    this package that define the formats and organization structures of the AD data
    across multiple data sources. R Functions are provided for data analysts to
    integrate data from multiple data sources and create their analysis datasets.
