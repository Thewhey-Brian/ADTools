\description{
This dictionary includes the basic setting of subtables, such as "file_code",
"file_name", "start_row", and "date_format." In the raw data, the starting
row and date type may vary for different subtables. This dictionary could be
used to store these settings. Also, since the subtables will have different
names (maybe with time as a suffix), this dictionary is used to simplify the
subtable names.
